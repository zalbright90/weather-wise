# WeatherWise üå¶Ô∏è

WeatherWise is a dynamic weather application that provides real-time weather data for a user-specified location, including visual representations via GIFs that reflect the current weather conditions. This project leverages both the Visual Crossing API for weather data and the Giphy API for fetching weather-themed GIFs.

## Features
- Real-time Weather Data: Fetches current weather information and a 7-day forecast based on the user‚Äôs location input.
- GIF Integration: Displays a relevant GIF for the current weather conditions.
- Modular JavaScript: Built with modular JavaScript, making each function and feature separate and reusable.
- User Input: Users can input any location to get up-to-date weather data.
- Dynamic UI: The app's interface is updated dynamically using JavaScript, giving users an interactive experience.
